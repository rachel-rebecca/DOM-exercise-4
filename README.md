# DOM-exercise-4

This was an exercise for bootcamp at Grand Circus. Styling for the page was up to us and I wanted to add in my own drawn elements with the coins. The coins are meant to have a sketchy or cartoon-ish look to them.

requirements for the assignment were:
1. create a form element that asks for input on number of coins and tpye of coin.
2. when form is submitted, the coin will appear in the space below and the total will update to the chosen amount.
3. the user is able to click the coin and it will be removed. The total will also updated to subtract the amount of the removed coin.
